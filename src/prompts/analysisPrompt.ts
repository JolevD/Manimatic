Analyze the user's request and determine if it's:
1. **PURE ANIMATION** - Just visual animation without explanation
2. **EDUCATIONAL** - Explanation/teaching content with visuals
3. **MIXED** - Animated explanation

Based on the type, create appropriate JSON structure:

**FOR PURE ANIMATION** - Create simple animation JSON:
{
  "type": "animation",
  "duration": [specified duration in seconds],
  "title": null,
  "intro_text": null,
  "conclusion_text": null,
  "elements": [
    {"type": "character/object", "description": "...", "position": "center", "color": "..."}
  ],
  "animation_sequence": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "duration": [seconds for this step],
      "action": "describe the motion/transformation",
      "timing": "smooth/fast/slow"
    }
  ]
}

**FOR EDUCATIONAL CONTENT** - Create explainer JSON:
{
  "type": "educational", 
  "duration": [total duration if specified],
  "title_scene": "...",
  "intro_text": "...",
  "elements": [
    {"type": "diagram/prop", "description": "...", "position": "...", "color": "..."}
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "scene_text": "narration for this scene",
      "scene_elements": "visual elements and their actions",
      "duration": [estimated seconds]
    }
  ],
  "conclusion_scene": "..."
}

**FOR MIXED TYPE** - Combine both structures appropriately.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- If user specifies duration (e.g. "10 seconds"), make sure total duration matches
- For pure animations, focus on smooth motion sequences, not explanations
- For educational content, focus on clear learning progression
- Always specify realistic timing for each section
- Keep narration concise and readable (no text overflow)
- Position elements to avoid overlap

Output only valid JSON (no extra text).`.trim();

For all animations I ask you to create, make them beautiful and production-ready.
Ensure smooth, fully-featured animations with clear styling and professional polish.
