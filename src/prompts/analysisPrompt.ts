Analyze the user's request and determine if it's:
1. **PURE ANIMATION** - Just visual animation without explanation
2. **EDUCATIONAL** - Explanation/teaching content with visuals
3. **MIXED** - Animated explanation

Based on the type, create appropriate JSON structure:

**FOR PURE ANIMATION** - Create simple animation JSON:
{
  "type": "animation",
  "duration": [specified duration in seconds],
  "title": null,
  "intro_text": null,
  "conclusion_text": null,
  "elements": [
    {"type": "character/object", "description": "...", "position": "center", "color": "..."}
  ],
  "animation_sequence": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "duration": [seconds for this step],
      "action": "describe the motion/transformation",
      "timing": "smooth/fast/slow"
    }
  ]
}

**FOR EDUCATIONAL CONTENT** - Create explainer JSON:
{
  "type": "educational", 
  "duration": [total duration if specified],
  "title_scene": "...",
  "intro_text": "...",
  "elements": [
    {"type": "diagram/prop", "description": "...", "position": "...", "color": "..."}
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "scene_text": "narration for this scene",
      "scene_elements": "visual elements and their actions",
      "duration": [estimated seconds]
    }
  ],
  "conclusion_scene": "..."
}

**FOR MIXED TYPE** - Combine both structures appropriately.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- If user specifies duration (e.g. "10 seconds"), make sure total duration matches
- For pure animations, focus on smooth motion sequences, not explanations
- For educational content, focus on clear learning progression
- Always specify realistic timing for each section
- Keep narration concise and readable (no text overflow)
- Position elements to avoid overlap

// - "title_scene": a title screen text (and optional subtitle) to introduce the topic.

//    • "scene_text": the narration for that scene (short and engaging).  
//    • "scene_elements": visual elements appearing in that scene (describe what and where, avoiding overlap).  
// - "conclusion_scene": a closing narration summarizing or concluding the topic.

// ANALYZE user request and output only valid JSON with keys:

// "elements": array of {"type","shape","color","position"}.
// "steps": array of action strings (animation sequence WITH NARRATION for each step).

// IMPORTANT: Every step must include narration text explaining what's happening visually to enhance understanding.

// "conclusion_scene": "The red circle has appeared smoothly with clear explanation."
// }
// Few-shot Example:
// Input:
// "Explain friction with animation"
// Expected Output:
// {
// "title_scene": "Friction Demonstration",
// "intro_text": "We'll see how friction slows down a sliding block.",
// "elements":[
// { "type":"object","shape":"Square","color":"GREY","position":"center" },

// "SlideIn Square from left with narration: 'Here comes our block, sliding across the surface'",
// "Apply friction force arrow with narration: 'Notice how friction creates an opposing force'",
// "Decelerate Square to stop with narration: 'The friction gradually brings our block to a complete stop'"
